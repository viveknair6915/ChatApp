## Procedure
### Part 1 - Login and Signup Forms
1. Users model
2. **Pages:** Login, Signup, Home, Profile, (part of send message, more in next part)
3. CRUD operations on profile(username, profile picture...)
### Part 2 - Chat application
1. Channels Library 
2. Implementing basic functionality first then redoing it in async
3. TODO: Redis can come during production, channel layer is set to `InMemoryChannelLayer` for development.
4. Converted basic functionality to async
5. Added context processors for sidebar channels
6. Two public channels exist which anyone should be able to use, authentication in the next part.
7. Added messages model for permanent storage
   
### Part 3(optional) - Authenticating WebSockets

1. The simplest approach is to use basic authentication provided by Channels by scoping our consumer in websocket connect function like so.  
*Note: AuthMiddlewareStack is required.*
```py
user = self.scope['user']
if user.is_authenticated:
    // authenticated user connection 
else:
    // unauthenticated acces - disconnect/close
```
2. Another approach is to use Tokens - essentially create a token on the client side and send it over to the backend for authentication.  
   * Requires custom middleware
   * Requires `djangorestframework`
   * Hard to work with because tokens cannot be passed to headers
   * Have to establish connection first, then send a token, might pose security risks

3. Third approach is to use sessions

The first and second approaches are covered in this application, look `session-based` branch for the third approach.
